* Title:       Release Note for CMSIS
*
* -------------------------------------------------------------------

The Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS)
provides a single standard across all Cortex-Mx processor series
vendors. It enables code re-use and code sharing across software
projects and reduces time-to-market for new embedded applications.

CMSIS is released under the terms of the end user license agreement
("CMSIS END USER LICENCE AGREEMENT.pdf").  Any user of the software
package is bound to the terms and conditions of the end user license
agreement.

In this projct, for simplicity, the actual CMSIS files are in the
stm32f0 subdirectory, not in their usual location.
