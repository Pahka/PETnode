- fix #if 0s out from enc28j60_packet.c
- Initialise USART for debugging
- fix clock.c settings, most probably they are wrong
  - seconds not implemented
  - frequency option probably set wrong
- Study ChibiOS/RT as an alternative to Contiki
  - implement Contiki basic process/protothread with ChibiOS?
