/*
 * 051 SPI DR is defined in the headers as a 16-bit register, even
 * when we are using 8-bit words in the SPI.  Now, when the RX and TX
 * FIFOs are used, each 16-bit read or write accesses two bytes in the
 * FIFO.  When writing, the LSB is the one sent first, and when
 * reading, LSB is the one that was received first.
 *
 * Here we attempt to keep the SPI busy all the time, even if there
 * was slight jitter caused by other threads (not implemented yet).
 * Hence, we first fill the TX FIFO with the command byte and the
 * first word from the buffer, i.e. altogether three bytes.
 *
 * The main loop waits for there to be space available in the TX FIFO,
 * i.e. there being space for at least two bytes (and at most two bytes)
 * in the FIFO, filling then the FIFO with the next two bytes.  At
 * that point the TX FIFO typically has four bytes in it temporarily.
 *
 * At the RX side, we first wait there to be two bytes in the RX FIFO,
 * and then read them, often emptying the FIFO.  After that we go back
 * to the writing side.
 *
 * Once there is nothing left for writing, read the last two bytes.
 *
 * XXX The plan is to replace this with DMA, but that hasn't been
 * implemented yet.
